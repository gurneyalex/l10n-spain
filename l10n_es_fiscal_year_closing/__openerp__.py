Spanish fiscal year closing wizard
    
Replaces the default OpenERP end of year wizards (from account module)
with a more advanced all-in-one wizard that will let the users:
  - Check for unbalanced moves, moves with invalid dates
    or period or draft moves on the fiscal year to be closed.
  - Create the Loss and Profit entry.
  - Create the Net Loss and Profit entry.
  - Create the Closing entry.
  - Create the Opening entry.

It's highly configurable, and comes preconfigured for the current Spanish chart of accounts.

It takes in account deferral method set in account types:
  - None: Nothing is done for this account.
  - Balance: Create account move line with the balance of the year for the account.
  - Detail: Create one account move line for each partner with balance for the account.
  - Unreconciled: Not supported.

Also is stateful, saving all the info about the fiscal year closing, so the
user can cancel and undo the operations easily.

##Serv. Tecnol. Baeza##: Modified for ignoring account moves in 'Other' journey.
